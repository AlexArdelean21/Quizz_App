  answer: "a. alegerea unui individ părinte/membru al generației următoare; c. alegerea individului cel mai bun din 3 indivizi considerați aleator în multisetul pe care este aplicată; e. inducerea unei presiuni de selecție superioară celei uniforme.",
  explanation: "Selecția turneu implică alegerea a 3 indivizi aleatori și selectarea celui mai bun dintre ei, ceea ce duce la o presiune de selecție mai mare decât selecția uniformă."
